    "worms": "Chickens may be infected with a range of many intestinal worms. In general worm infections are not associated with mortality but can have an adverse effect on productivity. Worm burdens are usually greater in backyard production due to difficulty in control and the frequent use of anti-helminthic drugs in commercial production.The clinical signs associated with heavy intestinal worm burden are non-specific, but include loss of weight, appetite, condition and productivity, and in some cases diarrhoea with or without passage of worms or worm segments. Diagnosis is by clinical signs, the visible presence of worms and the identification of worm eggs in faeces by microscopy.Worm eggs shed in the faeces are directly picked up by chickens and can also lead to contaminated feed or water. Certain worm species, require an intermediate host, such as an earthworm or beetle, which can be readily eaten by the chicken when scavenging. Worm eggs can survive in temperate conditions in the environment for many months.",
    "intanNema": "Intestinal Nematodes",
    "intanNema1": "Perhaps the easiest intestinal heminths to diagnose are large roundworms, such as Ascaridia galli which can measure 5-10cm in length. Ascaridia live in the small intestine and infection can cause to damage of the intestinal mucosa that can lead to enteritis and failure to thrive",
    "intanNema2": "Capillaria spp. are small nematodes that parasitize different parts of the intestinal tract dependent on the species.High Capillaria burdens can lead to disease",
    "intanNema3": "Heterakis gallinarum is a caecal nematode which causes little damage itself, but in the main carrier of Histomonas",
    "gapeworm": "Gapeworm",
    "gapworm1": "The gapeworm Syngamus trachea can be found in the trachea and lungs of infested birds, with high burdens cause the disease gapes which may manifest as difficulty breathing (breathing with an open beak) and cyanosis leading potentially to death.Syngamus eggs may persist for a long time in environment meaning the infection is most frequent in outdoor reared animals",
    "tapworm": "Tapeworm",
    "tapeworm1": "Multiple species of Tapeworms may be found in the chicken, with species such as Raillietina species and Davainea proglottina found in the small intestine the most frequently associated with clinical disease"
